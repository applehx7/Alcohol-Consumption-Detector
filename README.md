# Alcohol Consumption Detector

**Alcohol-Consumption-Detector** is a machine learning model that predicts whether a user is a drinker or non-drinker based on demographic and behavioral data. The model uses classification algorithms to analyze features like age, gender, and lifestyle choices to make predictions.

## Features

- **Predictive Model**: Classifies users as drinkers or non-drinkers.
- **Data Analysis**: Uses demographic and behavioral features such as age, gender, and smoking habits.
- **Classification Algorithms**: Implements machine learning algorithms to predict alcohol consumption.


## Dataset

This project uses the **Smoking and Drinking Dataset** from Kaggle, which includes data on smoking and drinking habits. You can download the dataset from the following link:

- [Smoking and Drinking Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sooyoungher/smoking-drinking-dataset)

The dataset contains the following features:
- **Age**: The age of the user.
- **Gender**: Gender of the user.
- **Smoking Habit**: Whether the user smokes or not.
